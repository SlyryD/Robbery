# Robbery: A card game

## Rules
Robbery is a card game I learned via word of mouth. My friend, who taught the game to me 5 years ago, learned it from another friend who learned to play it in Pakistan. Playing the game is fairly easy. You start the game with 4 cards. On your turn, you draw from the deck so that you have 5 cards in your hand. If any of your hand cards have the same value as cards on the board or in the opponent's vault, then you can put all of those cards into your vault. You then draw so that you have 5 cards again and repeat. You may discard 1 card from your hand to end your turn. Once the deck runs out, you do not draw during your turn. The game ends once both players have no cards in their hands. You then count up your points: 5 points for cards with value 2-7, 10 points for cards with value 8-K, and 20 points for Aces.

## Gameplay
Click on cards in your hand in order to play them. You can click on matching cards on the board or in the opponent's vault in order to loot those cards and put them in your vault. You can click on the Discard button that appears in order to discard the cards.

## Music
I composed and arranged the music seen in this game. The first song is called "Thought", which I composed using MuseScore. I used Audacity to edit the resulting mp3 file so that it could loop and eventually end. The second song, in the credits, is a knockoff of the James Bond theme. I arranged the whole song, even though only a small portion of it appeared in the credits.

## External resources
The card assets were obtained from the Card Game Starter Kit from the Unity asset store (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/6193). These cards were generated by PCI: Procedural Creations. The cards came with a simple flipping animation. I used the these card assets as game objects, as well as the flipping animation. I additionally modified the flipping animation so that the cards could travel in an arc without flipping.
